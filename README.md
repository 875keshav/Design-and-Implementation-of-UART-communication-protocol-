# Design-and-Implementation-of-UART-communication-protocol-
## Communication Protocol
Communication protocols are a set of rules that governs how the data is transmitted, received, and processed between different components within a system or between two different systems. Some commonly used Communication protocols are UART, SPI, I2C, etc.
## Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART):
Universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART) is an asynchronous serial communication protocol that transmits the data serially between two devices. It is a two wire communication protocols in which one wire is used for transmitting the data while, the second wire is used for reception of data.
